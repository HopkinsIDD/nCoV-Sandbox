# nCoV Sandbox



# What is this?

The nCoV Sandbox is a running analytic blog we are "writing" as we try to apply some methods we had in the very early stages of development, and some old friends, to the 2019 nCoV outbreak. It also is us trying to run some analyses to get our on handle on, and keep up to date on, the epidmeiology of the emerging epidemic.

This is a bit of an excercise in radical transparency, and things are going start out very messy...but will hopefully get cleaner and more meaningful as things go. But the old stuff will (for the moment) remain at the bottom for posterity.


**We have moved the analytive blog to github pages, and it can be accessed here: https://hopkinsidd.github.io/nCoV-Sandbox/**
